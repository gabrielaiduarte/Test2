# Description
Test 2 was based on Git Operations in Projects. The operations included the basics, from creating a Git Repo, adding a project board, to Initial commits. It also included the creation of Issues for 5 different test cases, a branch would be created for each one of the test cases and I worked with pull requests and merging to the main branch throughout the test. The project board was updated accordingly one, task at the time.
